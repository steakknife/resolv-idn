# Deprecated

## IDN (including NAMEPREP and STRINGPREP), should be implemented in Ruby stdlib to resolv, uri and net/\*, not as a brittle hack.  Furthermore, since enough people think this is a good idea but have only complained instead of pitching in and suggested ripping off this, I am no longer going to support it.  Instead, someone from the Ruby community familiar with the stdlib codebase could implement this.  Until then, use something else, because hacks aren't scalable.
